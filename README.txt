Random FFXIV I Use

Simple scripts to press buttons in FFXIV to facilitate the repeating of in game macros by sending key presses via PostMessage to the game client.
This allows for macros to be repeated simply by, assigned the keys that are being pressed, the wait values, and the number of times it should loop.
